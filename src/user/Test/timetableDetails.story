Narrative:
In order to know when sessions happen
As a lecturer
I want to see the details (time, location, students, tutor) for every timetable slot in a session

Scenario: A lecturer begins her teaching week and wishes to know how her/his timetable is looking for the upcoming week in order to organize other activities
Given the timetable function in the system
When the lecturer needs to know all her information for the upcoming week
then the system will display all the timetable slots and their information for her.
