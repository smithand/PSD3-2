Narrative:
To avoid creating a large number of sessions
As a lecturer
I want to specify that a session is a one off, or recurs weekly or fortnightly

Scenario: A Lecturer will be organizing a one-off presentation by a firm wanting to talk to the student
Given the details for the upcoming presentation
When the lecturer organizes the session via the system
and has the relevant information
then they can make sure that the event only appears on the time-slot it has been organized for
