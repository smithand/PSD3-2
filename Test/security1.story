Narrative:
In order to seperate functions and provide correct functionality through personas
As a User
I want the relevant distinction between: students, lecturers, admins and tutors

Scenario: A user logs in to the system
Given the correct log-in details
When the user logs in
and he checks what functionality he has
then he should only be able to access information and functions that suit his user persona without being able to make dangerous changes
